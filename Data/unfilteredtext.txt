みどり08/07/2020
yea idk :relieved::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:
earlier my mum told me about my spoilt ass cousins who basically got £1500 from both their parents  who aren't together anymore
and idk i guess I kinda envy the way they always had money advantages and parent advantages compared to our family
and they're the type to rub it in ur face as well
and he just bought an custom ipad Pro and pen with his name engraved in it
and ig I got a bit worked up bc,,, idk my dad just left u kno
leon02four08/07/2020
o wow
みどり08/07/2020
his dad left, but he still gives them support in a way, u know?
1k for his 16th birthday? I didn't even get a card from my dad u kno
and he always yearns for that father figure and fking moans about it all the time idk
it just for me riled up,,,
leon02four08/07/2020
o :(
みどり08/07/2020
ugh anyway it was stoopid so
leon02four08/07/2020

みどり08/07/2020
yea hi I can't believe i even think about my dad when my mum is such an OP parent. honestly
shes better than what I could ever ask for, yet I still wonder and ask why my dad left smh
she plays the role of father and mother yet i still wish for an actual father
how spoilt >:((
talk about daddy issues >:(((
man I'm so gross
ugh I'm sleeping again gn
leon02four08/07/2020
I mean I don't think it really counts as spilt to want both parents in ur life
seems completely justified to me
ur mum does seem really nice tho xd
okay tho lol goodnight again
I'll be here for u unless u take like half an hour in-between texts then i probably fell asleep
leon02four08/07/2020
okay I'm sleeping now lol

I don't think anybody would call you spoilt for wanting a father figure in your life
みどり08/07/2020

leon02four08/07/2020
o

みどり08/07/2020
maybe cos it isn't so big and the lights are dim
also theres less colour on my phone cos I put everything on night/dark mode so there isn't so much colour saturation to burn out my eyes
leon02four08/07/2020
yea well i have my pc brightness at 0 as well lol
みどり08/07/2020

みどり08/07/2020
o ok
yea well everytime I played a game,, everyone would be simping, just saying :relieved::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:
leon02four08/07/2020
o
nobody simped for me :pensive:
みどり08/07/2020
I think its cos they thought I was a boy and I actually had good grammar..
unlike those eboys who would be like 'haha ur skin looks awsom will u dateeme'
leon02four08/07/2020
why would they simp for u if they thought u were a boy lol
みどり08/07/2020
also my skin looked cool maybe thats why
I meant girLS
GAMERGIRLS
leon02four08/07/2020
O

leon02four08/07/2020
his persona is very like
anime
shy
timid
like that
みどり08/07/2020
cos i always feel like when someone knows there's a girl on the team, they immediately look down on them? if u get a shit kill or if u do slightly less than what they want, they'll be like 'smh ur probably a girl ffs'
leon02four08/07/2020
and then one time he was playing ac with his top donators
and there's like 10 of them
then he gets in to discord vc andthey're all girls
lol
みどり08/07/2020
and they might simp over u in different games, and icbb for that shit lmaoao I just wanna play without the bs treatment

leon02four08/07/2020
o

みどり08/07/2020
yea they call me kiddo or boy

leon02four08/07/2020
yea maybe if u had like a lilypichu voice ppl would notice
みどり08/07/2020
I think I'd kms if I had a high voice tho

Shakespeare is easier to understand imo??
leon02four08/07/2020
idk tbh I've never read a proper shakespeare play
みどり08/07/2020
in S1 we read the script for merchant of Venice, and it was understandable despite the change of some phrases, u kno

leon02four08/07/2020
well we watched a movie on Romeo and Juliet in s3
みどり08/07/2020
I only remember the beginning sentence, 'to bait fish with all:' and thats it lmao
O
its probably much more simplified and nicer tho
cos in the original story, they both die iirc?
leon02four08/07/2020
who dies
Romeo and Juliet?
みどり08/07/2020
romeo and Juliet
ye
leon02four08/07/2020
yea
みどり08/07/2020
Juliet fakes her death and then romeo is like :O and then he kills himself and then Juliet finds out or smt and perishes too
idk tho
leon02four08/07/2020
she eats the poison and fakes her death
ye
みどり08/07/2020
ye sad times
leon02four08/07/2020
then romeo is like "bruh my love is dead imma head out"
みどり08/07/2020
star crossed lovers are such a good trope tho :pleading_face::pleading_face::pleading_face:
leon02four08/07/2020

leon02four08/07/2020

leon02four09/07/2020

みどり09/07/2020

leon02four09/07/2020

my question still stands tho
are charity shops even open atm
みどり09/07/2020
and sell them for real cheap bc they're like 'o it's just playing cards lmao' but it's pretty good
well,, whenever it opens..
leon02four09/07/2020

みどり09/07/2020

tbh i just want some standard playing cards to wreck through as I learn tricks, and to also play some daifugo xd
nahh sometimes they sell it for liek £1 in shops
leon02four09/07/2020
ye but u can get like high quality cards online
and they'll probably last 10x longer than £1
みどり09/07/2020
yea but i dont want too pricey cards bc i want to learn tricks and carry around a pack
something replaceable but durable enough
and £1 is cheap so I wouldn't mind the loss too much :thinking: :thinking:
leon02four09/07/2020
oic
みどり09/07/2020
also i just done a card trick on my mum and i was like 'so is this ur card :relieved::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:'

leon02four10/07/2020
xdddd
みどり10/07/2020

idek why
I also got ferrofluid in a bottle :relieved::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:
leon02four10/07/2020
yea i bought the polar pen like last year
after like 4 years of internal hyping it up
みどり10/07/2020

i use a polar pen part to make screwdrivers magnetic
みどり10/07/2020
u paid £20 to be called cool whenever someone paid attention to ur pen
leon02four10/07/2020

cos we have screwdrivers that look like this
so u can plop a segment on the flat end of that
and it turns the screwdriver magnetic
みどり10/07/2020
oh i have that
I used that for my glasses
and then lost the screw
leon02four10/07/2020
o
みどり10/07/2020

みどり10/07/2020

leon02four10/07/2020

みどり10/07/2020
wtf now I sound weird lol
leon02four10/07/2020
what would go too deep in ur mouth
vat19 giant gummy worm?
みどり10/07/2020
like if I get the thing to clean ur ears, I would be okay with it, but i get random thoughts to what if I dive too deep and become deaf or my ear bleeds??? idk I'm creative like that
leon02four10/07/2020
o
yea did u know ur not meant to put that like in ur ears
ur meant to only clean the outside
みどり10/07/2020
what would go too deep in ur mouth
a dick, probably
o
leon02four10/07/2020
o
みどり10/07/2020
ok
haha well sike, bc i wouldnt suck dick :D
that's like the last thing I'd want to do
leon02four10/07/2020
o ok good to know xd
みどり10/07/2020
would u ever suck dick?
leon02four10/07/2020
idk maybe for money
i'd do it for 1k
みどり10/07/2020
o
O
leon02four10/07/2020
jk probably not
maybe if it was more tho :thinking:
みどり10/07/2020
o
O
yea no i would N E V E R
that's just gross idk
also i have strong gag reflex so I'll just die
leon02four10/07/2020
oic
みどり10/07/2020
yea
:[
leon02four10/07/2020
do ppl throw up from sucking dick
lol
みどり10/07/2020
I-
I dont think so
i hope not :flushed::flushed::flushed:
leon02four10/07/2020
vomit :yum:
みどり10/07/2020
usually tho,, with gag reflex, u just kinda gag for 2 seconds but u adjust :flushed::flushed::flushed:
but yeah no thanks id rather not gag in the first place :relieved::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:
leon02four10/07/2020
ye but can't u make urself throw up by sticking fingers down ur throat
lol

cursed
みどり10/07/2020
well yeah, but usually it's to activate ur gag reflex so that you gag out ur insides
mostly u control that part
idk my gag reflexes don't make me puke,, i can literally just puke on demand
leon02four10/07/2020
o
do it now
みどり10/07/2020
OK
:face_vomiting:
leon02four10/07/2020
o
well done :clap: :clap:
みどり10/07/2020
well anyway my gag reflex is just there anyway
I remember this one time I gagged tho and then i puked out blood :relieved::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:
leon02four10/07/2020
what
what the fuck kristi
みどり10/07/2020
because I put something in my mouth too deep and it literally caused me to gag out blood
that sounds a bit questionable, but it was a toothbrush lol
leon02four10/07/2020
bruh ur like those anime characters when they get punched
are u sure u didn't have like a broken lung or something
みどり10/07/2020
yea maybe thats why i have a fear of things going too deep :thinking: :thinking: :thinking:
leon02four10/07/2020
wait
why did u put a toothbrush down ur throat
みどり10/07/2020
imagine sucking dick and then puking blood on it
I didnt intend to
I was brushing my tongue and then i pushed too deep
leon02four10/07/2020
tbh that's understandable tho i'd be scared of gagging too if i fkin puked blood before
why were u brushing ur tongue
lmaoaoao
みどり10/07/2020
maybe it was too sudden and too deep at once?? idk
wdym??... u literally brush ur tongue? lmao look it up plez
leon02four10/07/2020
wait waht
みどり10/07/2020
its to get the shit off of it
leon02four10/07/2020
o yo wtf ur meant to brush ur tongue??
みどり10/07/2020
there are tongue brushes too, but i dumped mine ages ago
leon02four10/07/2020
ok guess i'm gonna have tongue cavities then :pensive:
i've never brushed my tongue before lmao
みどり10/07/2020
o
well for some people I guess it's fine but sometimes it's gross lol
anyway tho
don't choke on ur toothbrush kids :pensive::pensive:
leon02four10/07/2020
yea ok xdd

みどり10/07/2020
o

leon02four10/07/2020

みどり10/07/2020
o
OK that's a good idea
leon02four10/07/2020
ye i mean like 80% of the time i don't play with thom
lmao
みどり10/07/2020
cos there's never just one game when it comes to league
leon02four10/07/2020
if i played every time with thom every time he asked
u would never talk to me
xd
みどり10/07/2020
O

leon02four10/07/2020

leon02four10/07/2020
o
yea dw i'm not league addicted like thom
well not as league addicted as thom anyways
みどり10/07/2020
ye ok
btw i started reading some of the summer school stuff and so far, it's literally just about windows
leon02four10/07/2020
o
wait what kinda window
like a house window
or pc windows 10 window
みどり10/07/2020
also from friday (aka today) u can have people from 2 households at ur house, eg, me and osc
well its written like the 19th century, so normal windows xd
leon02four10/07/2020
o naisu
o
lol
ok
what is there to say about windows though
is it a story about windows?? lol
みどり10/07/2020
ik..
its English lit, so they'll find a way
leon02four10/07/2020
ic xdd
みどり10/07/2020
yea, idk why but English literature always finds a way to speak about the most boring things in the least entertaining way possible
leon02four10/07/2020
lmaoaoao
みどり10/07/2020
today, we shall engage ourselves in the topic of,, bricks.
the life of a manmade rock material, withstanding whatever nature throws at it, is recognised as a crimson coloured rectangle. Often used as a building resource, with the paint chips flaking from the brick, is used widely amongst us humans. However, there is more to the material, than just a measly plain brick.
CH1: introduction
leon02four10/07/2020
zzzzzzz
i'm falling asleep just listening to u
/s
みどり10/07/2020
yea same
I'm falling asleep just writing it
leon02four10/07/2020
yea that's why u took so long to send that message
u literally dozed off halfway through typing it
みどり10/07/2020
ye literally idek what to say
leon02four10/07/2020
xdddd
みどり10/07/2020
yea well the piece is about windows and then she talks about herself
and then back to the windows
and old people bicker about how significant/insignificant the windows were/are
and then i got bored and shuffled cards
leon02four10/07/2020
today, we shall engage ourselvese in the topic of bricks
bricks can be made by smelting clay in a furnace. you can find clay in the bottom of rivers. bricks can be made to craft flowerpots with 3 bricks in a u shape on a crafting table
they can also be used to make brick blocks, although they look pretty shit compared to stone bricks
みどり10/07/2020
ok but the difference between this and my English piece is that I actually understand wtf ur talking about
leon02four10/07/2020
in modded 1.12, there is a recipe in ex nihilo that allows you to convert dust into clay by using a barrel and water. This allows production of clay to be possible in skyblock worlds, where rivers and lakes are inaccessible
みどり10/07/2020
the thing about the English piece is that they literally talk about one thing, and then discuss it to its most complicated denotations, and then further explain it to the point where I'm just like :]]] wtf
leon02four10/07/2020
xdd
i can tell ur gonna have fun in summer school lol
みどり10/07/2020
I wanna drop out already :relieved::sparkles::sparkles:

leon02four10/07/2020
ye u should actually do it
みどり10/07/2020
its not to 'be hired', I enjoy doing it too so it's more of an offer or exchange kinda thing xd
leon02four10/07/2020
exchange for money tho? :thinking:
みどり10/07/2020
besides being the first to read something before release has a kind of satisfaction feel to it :thinking: :thinking:
no, more like exchange for time to talk about ships

みどり10/07/2020
:eyes: :sweat_drops: :sweat_drops: :sweat_drops:
ye i had a dream that I couldn't sleep
....
that's a bit ironic
leon02four10/07/2020
bruh
so u were lying in bed awake while you are lying in bed asleep
みどり10/07/2020
ye so I had to try sleeping downstairs, in my brother's room, and basically everywhere but I still couldn't sleep
yea basically
leon02four10/07/2020
u went to ur brothers room to sleep? lol
みどり10/07/2020
but at the same time, I knew I was sleeping irl?? maybe that's why I couldn't sleep in the dream idk
yea in my dreAM
leon02four10/07/2020
onii-chan i cant sleep :pleading_face:
みどり10/07/2020
no he wasn't even in his room
lol
leon02four10/07/2020
ye maybe if u fell asleep in ur dream you'd dream about dreaming about not being able to sleep again
みどり10/07/2020
and in case u never noticed
me and my brother never call each other by our names
:O
leon02four10/07/2020
ye
みどり10/07/2020
I always call him 哥哥 and he calls me 妹妹 but then he just says it so weird and it becomes midori half the time
so ye
leon02four10/07/2020
why would he still say it weird tho
みどり10/07/2020
he says it weird on purpose lol
leon02four10/07/2020
oic
lol
みどり10/07/2020
idk he has like 1392928 ways of saying it
but so do I, so o well
leon02four10/07/2020
u should call him onii chan
みどり10/07/2020
哥哥 is like.. gō gō, but i used to say dō dō when I was loli
leon02four10/07/2020
dodo airlines
みどり10/07/2020
esp if I want water, I'll do a loli voice and say it nicely
leon02four10/07/2020
o
lmao
みどり10/07/2020
ye i was talking about that to him when he got the game xdd
anyway tho, so would call him dottery nowadays
leon02four10/07/2020
wha
みどり10/07/2020
like we change up the normal way of saying it to make new nicknames, idk it's weird lmaoaoao
sibling stuff, what can I say
leon02four10/07/2020
lmao okay xdd
みどり10/07/2020
ye so from dottery, I sometimes just call him dot
like a literal DOT.
.
leon02four10/07/2020
what's dottery tho
みどり10/07/2020
it came from me saying dōdō
leon02four10/07/2020
o lmao
みどり10/07/2020
yea ikr
leon02four10/07/2020
u could make a YouTube short documentary on the history of martin nicknames
みどり10/07/2020
ye maybe
he rarely called me little sister tho
he did until he was like 10 or smt bc he fucked up the pronunciation and called me rice instead
leon02four10/07/2020
bruh
みどり10/07/2020
yea but it's okay cos I like rice
and then my mum would call me rice too
leon02four10/07/2020
rice kristi
like rice crispies but kristi version
みどり10/07/2020
rice is obviously 米, but he'd say it twice, like how I'd say 哥哥, so it just became 米米 with a different pronunciation
different tone, actually
ugh it sounds so complicated but it's not xd
so basically
I'm rice
leon02four10/07/2020
lol
hi rice
I'm dad
みどり10/07/2020

みどり12/07/2020
or a nice flashy deck
leon02four12/07/2020
i don't think a nice flashy deck is gonna cost £2 only xd
wtf

みどり12/07/2020
well apparently blue seals are very authentic and nice but idk
wait what LMAO
leon02four12/07/2020
its in the q&a section of an amazon card
it doesn't matter if you're right handed or not tho
does it ??
also wanna play mccccccc
みどり12/07/2020
I dont think it matters imo
I can do on both hands but better on my left
it just depends on ur hand position/grip
and noooo bc my family is watching their jp drama on netflix
:pensive::pensive::pensive:

みどり12/07/2020
oh man that 3rd one

leon02four12/07/2020
also teemo (bottom right)
do be looking like tom nook
ye
lmaoaoao
みどり12/07/2020
ye lmaoao
hows league
leon02four12/07/2020
its okay
season 10 ends in like a month
so i'm trying to climb ranks
so now i'm silver 2
みどり12/07/2020
o i see
whats the ranking system
I kinda stopped playing owowatch again...
leon02four12/07/2020
and thom wants to duo with me but i just patch him
みどり12/07/2020
cos i put in the p5r disc, and icbb changing.. so I guess I won't be playing for a while.. again xd
o i see
leon02four12/07/2020
o yea i don't play owowatch either lmao
みどり12/07/2020
lmaoao
leon02four12/07/2020
ranks are
iron -> bronze -> silver -> gold -> plat -> diamond -> masters
each rank goes 1 to 4 with 4 being the worst
みどり12/07/2020
oic
leon02four12/07/2020
and a cap of 100 LP which u gain from winning
みどり12/07/2020
oic
LP?
its cp for us
league points?
leon02four12/07/2020
LP is the mmr system
idk tbh lmao
みどり12/07/2020
O
ok xd
leon02four12/07/2020
o wow it actually is league points
that's kinda a stupid name xdddd
みどり12/07/2020
ye I figured it was smt basic
cp is competitive points xd
leon02four12/07/2020
anyways after u reach master, there's no cap on 100LP to reach the next rank
so its like top x of the region
みどり12/07/2020
oic
yea thats cool
leon02four12/07/2020
so once u get to masters, u just increase your LP until u get top 700 for grandmasters
みどり12/07/2020
wish owowatch was like that :]
leon02four12/07/2020
then top 300 for challenger
and then u can climb challenger to be number 1 for no reason
what's owowatch like tho lol
みどり12/07/2020
yea idk
but jank
xd
leon02four12/07/2020
o
lol
みどり12/07/2020
unless they changed it now
I think u should play persona5
leon02four12/07/2020

みどり12/07/2020

leon02four12/07/2020
i think u should give me ur ps4
i'll swap ur cards

seems good?
みどり12/07/2020

:pensive::pensive::pensive: I'm desperate but not like this xd
leon02four12/07/2020

みどり12/07/2020

leon02four12/07/2020
u better be paying for shipping for those cards tho

みどり12/07/2020
sorry bb I don't pay for shipping

leon02four12/07/2020

みどり12/07/2020
she doesnt like the concept of things being owned beforehand
leon02four12/07/2020
my mum loves charity shops lol
みどり12/07/2020
also we're superstitious asf and some items might have sentimental value/ aka spirits are more attached to it, etc etc
leon02four12/07/2020
